# Elmish Playground

This is a small breakable Fable/Elmish project I'm using to experiment and tinker with this stack.

## Requirements

* [dotnet SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core) 5.0 or higher
* [node.js](https://nodejs.org)
* An F# editor like Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code with [Ionide](http://ionide.io/) or [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)

## Building and running the app

* Install dependencies: `npm install`
* Start the compiler in watch mode and a development server: `npm start`
* After the first compilation is finished, in your browser open: http://localhost:8080/

Any modification you do to the F# code will be reflected in the web page after saving.
